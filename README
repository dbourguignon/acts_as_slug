ActsAsSlug
==========

Simple plugin to manage slugs in models.

Usage
=====

Models should have a slug column (string/varchar).

acts_as_slug(slug_array, slug_options)

options is a hash that may contains optional :separator and :append_id keys. 

Add :
acts_as_slug [:title]

To handle a slug using the title column.

slug_array parameter is an Array.

options can be :

:separator is a String that will be used to join the elements in order to create the slug.

:append_id : if set, acts_as_slug will not use a slug column to save the slug, but will generate dynamicaly a slug based on the slug_array and append the object id.

If you want to use different separators like '-by-', you should deactivate separator by specifying :separator => false.

Use a symbol to reference a column of the model, use a string to reference an association (ie.: "address.locality.name"), use a string beginning and ending by "/" for a static string (ie.: "/-by-/").

Note : when using find_with_slug!, if append_id option is set it uses the final id to find the object, otherwise it uses the slug column to find the object.

if the object cannot be retrieved :
- if append_id is set, it raise AR::RecordNotFound if the given id is not found. If the id is good but the slug is bad, it raises a SlugError exception. The good thing is that you
can catch the exception in ApplicationController and redirect to the good URL thanks to the retrieved_element attribute of the exception that contains the current element.
- if append_id is not set, it uses the slug column to find the element. If the element is not found, it raises AR::RecordNotFound.

Features
========

* Auto-sanitization of parameters for clean URLs (you must have unicode gem installed).
* Auto-incrementation of the slug. ActsAsSlug will add '-2' and so on if a record with the same slug exists.
* Will not fail or raise exception if a given parameter is nil or invalid, it will simply ignore it.

Examples
========

acts_as_slug [:title, '/-by-/', "author.login"], :separator => false

will create a slug like "loki-by-alexandre"

acts_as_slug [:title, "author.login"], :separator => '_'

will create a slug like "loki_alexandre"

acts_as_slug [:title], :append_id => true

will create a slug like "loki-9"
